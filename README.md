SringWS-Boot-Batch
==================

This is a simple spring boot app that calls a web service to get the total count of entities to be returned and then based off of that count, will divide and conquer using configurable, manageable chucks to pull back records that are then spit out into a zip file. Includes email notification of success/fail.
